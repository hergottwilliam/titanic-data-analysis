# titanic-data-analysis

The present study seeks to examine publicly available data from the Titanic exhibition of 1912. The information from passengers onboard the Titanic (n = 1309) includes age, sex, whether a passenger travelled alone or not, ticket fare, and whether a passenger survived the disaster or not. The goal of the present study is to examine whether passenger survival was related to sex, age (those 14 and under are considered children), ticket fare, and whether a passenger travelled alone or not. Regarding the Titanic disaster, previous research found that females were more likely to survive compared to men and that a passengerâ€™s chances of survival increased with an increased social class, with social class being measured using the class of travel (Hall, 1986). It is hypothesized that women will have a higher survival rate compared to men, children (14 and under) will have a higher survival rate compared to non-children, more expensive ticket fare will be associated with a higher survival rate compared to lower ticket fare, and that those who travelled alone will have a higher survival rate compared to those who did not.
